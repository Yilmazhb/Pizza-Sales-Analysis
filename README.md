# Pizza Sales Analysis

## Business Problem
While the restaurant has been successfully serving its customers, management lacks a deep, data-driven understanding of their own business performance. They are operating with intuition rather than insight, which makes it difficult to make strategic decisions. In essence, the business is sitting on a goldmine of data but lacks the capability to extract meaningful patterns and insights from it, hindering their growth, profitability, and operational efficiency.

## Solution 
To address these challenges, we will conduct a comprehensive analysis of the pizza sales data. The goal is to transform raw data into actionable insights that can directly inform business strategy. This project will ultimately empower the business to move from operating on guesswork to making informed, strategic decisions that drive growth and efficiency.
